The Web interface also facilitates community-based participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content by providing features to add notes to ontology terms, mappings between terms and ontology reviews based on criteria such as usability, domain coverage, quality of content, and documentation and support. {BioPortal} also enables integrated search of biomedical data resources such as the Gene Expression Omnibus ({GEO}), {ClinicalTrials}.gov, and {ArrayExpress}, through the annotation and indexing of these resources with ontologies in {BioPortal}. Thus, {BioPortal} not only provides investigators, clinicians, and developers 'one-stop shopping' to programmatically access biomedical ontologies, but also provides support to integrate data from a variety of biomedical resources.},

    abstract = {Summary: {biomaRt} is a new Bioconductor package that integrates {BioMart} data resources with data analysis software in Bioconductor. It can annotate a wide range of gene or gene product identifiers (e.g. {Entrez-Gene} and Affymetrix probe identifiers) with information such as gene symbol, chromosomal coordinates, Gene Ontology and {OMIM} annotation. Furthermore {biomaRt} enables retrieval of genomic sequences and single nucleotide polymorphism information, which can be used in data analysis. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is possible as the package executes direct {SQL} queries to the {BioMart} databases (e.g. Ensembl). The {biomaRt} package provides a tight integration of large, public or locally installed {BioMart} databases with data analysis in Bioconductor creating a powerful environment for biological data {mining.Availability}: http://www.bioconductor.org. {LGPLContact}: steffen.durinck@esat.kuleuven.ac.be},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Making data available as Linked Data using Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) promotes integration with other web resources. {RDF} documents can natively link to related data, and others can link back using Uniform Resource Identifiers ({URIs}). {RDF} makes the data machine-readable and uses extensible vocabularies for additional information, making it easier to scale up inference and data {analysis.RESULTS}:This paper describes recent developments in an ongoing project converting data from the {ChEMBL} database into {RDF} triples. Relative to earlier versions, this updated version of {ChEMBL}-{RDF} uses recently introduced ontologies, including {CHEMINF} and {CiTO}; exposes more information from the database; and is now available as dereferencable, linked data. To demonstrate these new features, we present novel use cases showing further integration with other web resources, including {Bio2RDF}, {Chem2Bio2RDF}, and {ChemSpider}, and showing the use of standard ontologies for 
{querying.CONCLUSIONS}:We have illustrated the advantages of using open standards and ontologies to link the {ChEMBL} database to other databases. Using those links and the knowledge encoded in standards and ontologies, the {ChEMBL}-{RDF} resource creates a foundation for integrated semantic web cheminformatics applications, such as the presented decision support.},

@article{Belleau2008,
    abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although {RDF} was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. {Bio2RDF} is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in {JSP}, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an {OWL} ontology. With {Bio2RDF}, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, {PDB}, {MGI}, {HGNC} and several of {NCBI}'s databases can now be made available in {RDF} format through a unique {URL} in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The {Bio2RDF} project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of {RDF} documents linked together with 
normalized {URIs} and sharing a common ontology. {Bio2RDF} is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The {Bio2RDF} repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Recently there has been an explosion of new data sources about genes, proteins, genetic variations, chemical compounds, diseases and drugs. Integration of these data sources and the identification of patterns that go across them is of critical interest. Initiatives such as {Bio2RDF} and {LODD} have tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data respectively using {RDF}. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains of chemistry and biology has been very {limitedRESULTS}:We have created a single repository called {Chem2Bio2RDF} by aggregating data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is cross-linked into {Bio2RDF} and {LODD}. We have also created a linked-path generation tool to facilitate {SPARQL} query generation, and have created extended {SPARQL} functions to address specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the utility of {Chem2Bio2RDF} in investigating polypharmacology, 
identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the association of pathways with adverse drug {reactions.CONCLUSIONS}:We have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource, and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and adverse drug reaction - pathway mapping. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of extending {SPARQL} with cheminformatics and bioinformatics functionality.},

    abstract = {Open {PHACTS} is a public–private partnership between academia, publishers, small and medium sized enterprises and pharmaceutical companies. The goal of the project is to deliver and sustain an 'open pharmacological space' using and enhancing state-of-the-art semantic web standards and technologies. It is focused on practical and robust applications to solve specific questions in drug discovery research. {OPS} is intended to facilitate improvements in drug discovery in academia and industry and to support open innovation and in-house non-public drug discovery research. This paper lays out the challenges and how the Open {PHACTS} project is hoping to address these challenges technically and socially. \^{a}º We discuss Open {PHACTS}, a project using semantic web standards and technologies. \^{a}º We discuss integration and mapping of disparate chemical and biological data types. \^{a}º The influence of data quality, crowdsourcing and curation is discussed. \^{a}º Open {PHACTS} will facilitate improvements in drug discovery in academia and industry.},

Data sources range from medicinal chemistry results, over the impact of drugs on gene expression, to the outcomes of drugs in clinical trials. These data are typically not connected together, which reduces the ease with which insights can be gained. Linking Open Drug Data ({LODD}) is a task force within the World Wide Web Consortium's ({W3C}) Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group ({HCLS} {IG}). {LODD} has surveyed publicly available data about drugs, created Linked Data representations of the data sets, and identified interesting scientific and business questions that can be answered once the data sets are connected. The task force provides recommendations for the best practices of exposing data in a Linked Data representation. In this paper, we present past and ongoing work of {LODD} and discuss the growing importance of Linked Data as a foundation for pharmaceutical {R\&D} data sharing.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Making data available as Linked Data using Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) promotes integration with other web resources. {RDF} documents can natively link to related data, and others can link back using Uniform Resource Identifiers ({URIs}). {RDF} makes the data machine-readable and uses extensible vocabularies for additional information, making it easier to scale up inference and data {analysis.RESULTS}:This paper describes recent developments in an ongoing project converting data from the {ChEMBL} database into {RDF} triples. Relative to earlier versions, this updated version of {ChEMBL}-{RDF} uses recently introduced ontologies, including {CHEMINF} and {CiTO}; exposes more information from the database; and is now available as dereferencable, linked data. To demonstrate these new features, we present novel use cases showing further integration with other web resources, including {Bio2RDF}, {Chem2Bio2RDF}, and {ChemSpider}, and showing the use of standard ontologies for {querying.CONCLUSIONS}:We have illustrated the advantages of using open standards and ontologies to link the {ChEMBL} database to other databases. Using those links and the knowledge encoded in standards and ontologies, the {ChEMBL}-{RDF} resource creates a foundation for integrated semantic web cheminformatics applications, such as the presented decision support.},

@article{Belleau2008,
    abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on different websites. Although {RDF} was proposed as a standard format for the web, these databases are still available in various formats. With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of bioinformatics knowledge integration. {Bio2RDF} is such a system, built from rdfizer programs written in {JSP}, the Sesame open source triplestore technology and an {OWL} ontology. With {Bio2RDF}, documents from public bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, {PDB}, {MGI}, {HGNC} and several of {NCBI}'s databases can now be made available in {RDF} format through a unique {URL} in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The {Bio2RDF} project has successfully applied the semantic web technology to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of {RDF} documents linked together with normalized {URIs} and sharing a common ontology. {Bio2RDF} is based on a three-step approach to build mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's disease. The {Bio2RDF} repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

Integration of these data sources and the identification of patterns that go across them is of critical interest. Initiatives such as {Bio2RDF} and {LODD} have tackled the problem of linking biological data and drug data respectively using {RDF}. Thus far, the inclusion of chemogenomic and systems chemical biology information that crosses the domains of chemistry and biology has been very {limitedRESULTS}:We have created a single repository called {Chem2Bio2RDF} by aggregating data from multiple chemogenomics repositories that is cross-linked into {Bio2RDF} and {LODD}. We have also created a linked-path generation tool to facilitate {SPARQL} query generation, and have created extended {SPARQL} functions to address specific chemical/biological search needs. We demonstrate the utility of {Chem2Bio2RDF} in investigating polypharmacology, identification of potential multiple pathway inhibitors, and the association of pathways with adverse drug {reactions.CONCLUSIONS}:We have created a new semantic systems chemical biology resource, and have demonstrated its potential usefulness in specific examples of polypharmacology, multiple pathway inhibition and adverse drug reaction - pathway mapping. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of extending {SPARQL} with cheminformatics and bioinformatics functionality.},
